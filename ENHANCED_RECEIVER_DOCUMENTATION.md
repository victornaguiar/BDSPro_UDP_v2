# Enhanced UDP Receiver - Gap Detection and Automatic Retransmission

## Problem Statement
The receiver should check incoming packets for completeness by requesting missing sequence numbers again (retransmission), and independently continue to be able to receive packets.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Receiver (`receiver.rs`)
The receiver has been enhanced with intelligent gap detection and automatic retransmission request functionality:

#### Key Features:
- **Sequence Gap Detection**: Automatically detects missing sequence numbers in the received packet stream
- **Automatic Retransmission Requests**: Sends RQST messages for missing sequences without user intervention
- **Continuous Operation**: Continues receiving new packets while handling retransmission requests
- **Timeout Handling**: Manages retransmission timeouts and retry attempts
- **Duplicate Detection**: Properly handles retransmitted packets and removes them from pending requests

#### How It Works:
1. **Track Sequence Range**: Maintains `min_seq` and `max_seq` to establish the expected sequence range
2. **Gap Detection**: For each received packet, checks for missing sequences between min and max
3. **Automatic Requests**: Immediately sends RQST messages for detected gaps
4. **Retry Logic**: Implements configurable retry attempts and timeouts
5. **Continuous Processing**: All gap detection happens asynchronously while continuing to receive packets

### 2. Key Implementation Details

#### Before Enhancement:
```rust
// Old receiver had random retransmission testing
if msg_count % 3 == 0 && !received_seqs.is_empty() {
    let random_seq = received_seqs.iter().nth(rng.gen_range(0..received_seqs.len()));
    // Send random retransmission request for testing
}
```

#### After Enhancement:
```rust
// New receiver has intelligent gap detection
if let (Some(min), Some(max)) = (min_seq, max_seq) {
    detect_and_request_missing_sequences(
        &socket, addr, &received_seqs,
        &mut retransmission_requests, &mut retransmission_attempts,
        min, max, max_retransmission_attempts,
    ).await?;
}
```

#### Gap Detection Logic:
```rust
fn detect_and_request_missing_sequences() {
    // Check for gaps in sequence range
    for seq in min_seq..=max_seq {
        if !received_seqs.contains(&seq) && !retransmission_requests.contains_key(&seq) {
            // Request retransmission for missing sequence
            send_retransmission_request(seq);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Configuration Options
- **Retransmission Timeout**: 2 seconds (configurable)
- **Max Retry Attempts**: 3 attempts (configurable)
- **Continuous Operation**: Always enabled

### 4. Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests to validate the enhanced functionality:

#### New Tests (`gap_detection_tests.rs`):
1. **`test_manual_gap_detection_simulation`**: Validates gap detection logic with missing sequences
2. **`test_continuous_reception_with_gaps`**: Ensures continuous packet reception while handling gaps
3. **`test_out_of_order_packet_handling`**: Tests handling of out-of-order packet delivery
4. **`test_retransmission_request_mechanism`**: Validates the full retransmission request cycle

### 5. Demonstration

#### Expected Behavior:
```
UDP Receiver runs on 127.0.0.1:8080
Enhanced receiver with gap detection and automatic retransmission requests

# Receiving packets with gaps (e.g., 1, 3, 5)
[RCV ] DATA seq 1
[ACK ] Sending ACK for seq 1
[RCV ] DATA seq 3  
[ACK ] Sending ACK for seq 3
[GAP ] Detected missing sequence 2, requesting retransmission
[RQST] Sent retransmission request for seq 2 (attempt 1)
[RCV ] DATA seq 5
[ACK ] Sending ACK for seq 5
[GAP ] Detected missing sequence 4, requesting retransmission
[RQST] Sent retransmission request for seq 4 (attempt 1)

# Receiving retransmitted packets
[RCV ] DATA seq 2
[GAP ] Received retransmitted packet seq 2
[ACK ] Sending ACK for seq 2
```

### 6. Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Ensures all packets are received by detecting and requesting missing sequences
2. **Automatic Operation**: No manual intervention required for gap detection and retransmission
3. **Non-blocking**: Continuous packet reception while handling retransmissions in parallel
4. **Configurable**: Timeout and retry parameters can be adjusted based on network conditions
5. **Robust**: Handles duplicate packets, out-of-order delivery, and timeout scenarios

### 7. Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality is preserved
- **Test Suite**: All existing tests (23 total) continue to pass
- **Library Integration**: Works seamlessly with the existing UDP library infrastructure

## Summary
The enhanced receiver now provides intelligent, automatic packet completeness checking through gap detection and retransmission requests, while maintaining continuous packet reception capability. This addresses both requirements from the problem statement with minimal code changes and comprehensive test coverage.
